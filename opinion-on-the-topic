When a user type https://www.google.com in a browser and hits enter, this is a secure transmission ( because it uses https ). https encrypt data transmitted between your browser and the server, making sensitive data difficult to access by interceptors. A TCP/IP then breaks data into packets to enable in the right order and make data reliable. With the use of DNS , a request (DNS request) is sent to a DNS server asking to identify the IP address associated with the domain name ( in our case google ) . With the IP address identified, data would be fetched from the web server with the IP address. A web server is a computer listening for incoming requests made on a browser and sending s response matching what was requested for. A browser uses what is known as a application server to make requests i.e request to a web server as stated earlier or to a database to fetch data, an example of application server is node.js. A database is a structured collection of data, we store data in a database in other to enable easy and fast access. example of database is mongoDB. we use application servers like node.js to fetch data from database by writing code which are mainly called queries.A firewall like the name states is a barrier between a client computer and the internet, it decide based on predefined rules which traffic ( incoming/ outgoing ) is authorised, and this helps protect use from unauthorised parties. In addition, a load balancer help distribute incoming traffic evenly accross servers to aid efficiency and consistency for users who make requests
